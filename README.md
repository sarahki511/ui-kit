# Project Overview

This project was carried out with the goal of making a ui kit (like that of bootstarp, materialUI, etc).\
This User Interface Kit provides you with consistent guidelines,
components and templates to boost the user experience of your products.

## About

UI Kit is the best way to unify web design and strengthen brand image.
This free UI Kit will help you create a unified website using easy to
use small components.\
This guideline will be used to help users add components to their websites
or other applications.\
This UI Kit is made as a personal project. The UX/UI is made with a
reference to many online guidelines; therefore, this document is not
made with specific and accurate practice of graphic design.

## Purpose

The purpose of this ui kit is to unify the overall image of the website.
This document will show the users how to use each components to make a
unifed and accessible website.\
Personal purpose of this project is to practice and showcase the study of
React, scss, css, html storybook. Making each user interface into small components
allow the components easy to manipulate and edit.

## Toolkit

Everything that is on the screen is made up of small unified components.
Starting from typograph to as big as a the entire web page, this ui kit
allows the website to have a more unified look. \
 Since this is a personal project, there will be a lot of errors and much
room to improve. Help me improve by sending me a feedback via
email (sarahki511@yahoo.com) or file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/sarahki511/ui-kit").

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
